Theory of Change generator
=============================

Overview
--------------

A tool that allows a specification of all the layers in the theory of change model and the interactions bewteen them. 

Generates an html document that shows each layer in order with the links in between.

usage:
```bash
$ python toc.py isa-toc.json > gentoc.html
```

Will output the html file so that you can open it. 
Note, uses python3 for now. Will switch it to python2 when I get a chance.
